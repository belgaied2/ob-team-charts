# Deprecated Packages

Within this repo our team maintains the packages (helm chart sources) for the charts our team publishes using this process. 
Eventually a Package, or specific version of a package, may no longer be maintained and does not need to be actively built anymore.
When a package reaches this stage they should be moved to this directory to preserve the sources.

No packages from this area will be used for builds nor should be modified after being placed here.
