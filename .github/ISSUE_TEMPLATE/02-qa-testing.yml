        âœ… After QA finishes testing:
        - QA will close this issue as normal.
        - Engineer merges the PR and updates the **root issue**.
        - When the change is included in the release branch (RC), QA will test the full release using the **root issue**.

        ðŸ”— Keep traceability: Always link this issue to the main one it supports. (Unless one does not exist.)
