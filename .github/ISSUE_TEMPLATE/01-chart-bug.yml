        ### üßæ Suggested Title Format:
        ```
        [<chart-slug>][<version>] <short description>
        ```
        Example:
        ```
        [rancher-monitoring][61.3] Update Curl version to 8.12+
        ```
        If there are multiple versions affected you can skip the version tag.

        ### üß† Title Guidelines
        Try to follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for the `<title>` part when possible.

        Example formats:
        - `fix: unexpected pod restarts in Grafana`
        - `feat: support custom scrape configs`
        - `chore: bump image version for Prometheus`

        This helps keep changelogs clean and meaningful!
